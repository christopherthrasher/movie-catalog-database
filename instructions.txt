Movie Catalog & Rating System – Setup Instructions

1. Overview

This project is a CLI Movie Catalog and Rating System built with Python and PostgreSQL.
It loads an external movie dataset from Kaggle into a PostgreSQL database and lets users:
    
    - browse movies
    - search by genre
    - create user accounts
    - submit ratings for movies
    - view ratings for a specific movie

All data is handled by the PostgreSQL database.

2. Tech Stack

Programming language: Python 3

Database: PostgreSQL

Python database library: psycopg3

User interface: Command-line interface (CLI)

4. Prerequisites

PostgreSQL installed and running

Python 3 installed

psycopg installed in Python

5. Database Setup

Create the database

CREATE DATABASE movie_catalog;

Configure connection settings
Open src/config.py and set the values to match your PostgreSQL setup:

DB_NAME = "movie_catalog"
DB_USER = "postgres"
DB_PASSWORD = "password"
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_PORT = 5432

Create the schema
In pgAdmin, run the SQL from db/schema.sql against the movie_catalog database to create all tables.

Place the external dataset
Ensure data/movies.csv exists in the data folder and matches the Kaggle movie dataset used for the project.

Import initial data
From the project root in a terminal:
cd src
python import_data.py

This script reads ../data/movies.csv and populates the database with movies, genres, directors, and actors.

6. Running the Application

From the src folder, run:
python cli.py

Menu options:

=== Movie Catalog ===
1) List movies
2) Search movies by genre
3) Rate a movie
4) View ratings for a movie
5) Exit

Option 1 – List movies
Displays titles and release years from the database.

Option 2 – Search movies by genre
Enter a genre name. Displays matching movies.

Option 3 – Rate a movie
Enter a username. If it doesn’t exist, you’ll be prompted to create one.
Then enter movie title, year, and a rating from 1 to 10.
The rating is stored in the rating table.

Option 4 – View ratings for a movie
Displays all user ratings and the average rating for that movie.

Option 5 – Exit
Closes the program.

7. Database Dumps

Two dump files are included in the db folder:
schema_dump.sql
data_dump.sql
